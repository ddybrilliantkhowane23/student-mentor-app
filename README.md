# student-mentor-app
A student advice application built with C++ backend and C# frontend. Provides study tips, coding guidance, and motivation for students.

# What This Project Does

This is a *Student Mentor App* that gives students advice for common problems like:
- Study tips 
- Coding guidance   
- Social relationships 
- Motivation & mental health 
- Career growth 

The cool part: it uses *two programming languages* working together!
- *C++* handles the advice processing and file saving
- *C#* creates a nice window to display the advice

# How to Run

# What You Need:
- Windows computer
- Code::Blocks (for C++)
- Visual Studio (for C#)
- USB stick (or change the file path in the code)

#  Steps on running the app:

1. *Plug in your USB* (should show as E: drive)

2. *Run the C++ Program:*
   - Open `StudentMentor.cpp` in Code::Blocks
   - Press *F9* to build and run
   - Enter your name
   - Choose advice category (1-5)
   - Press Enter

3. *Run the C# Program:*
   - Open `StudentMentorApp.sln` in Visual Studio 2019
   - Press *F5* to run
   - Click "START" on welcome screen
   - Select same category from the list
   - See your advice displayed!

4. *Repeat* for different advice categories!

# How It Works

1. *C++ Program* → Stores advice → Saves to `advices.txt` file
2. *C# Program* → Reads the file → Shows advice in nice window
3. *File* → Acts as bridge between the two programs

# Project Files

- `StudentMentor.cpp` - C++ backend program
- `WelcomeForm.cs` - C# welcome screen  
- `MentorForm.cs` - C# main advice screen
- `advices.txt` - Generated file 

# About Me

*MNQOBI KHOWANE* - 1st Year IT Student  
This was my creative project for CMPG121 to show I can build a complete application using multiple programming languages.

# Why I Built This

As a student myself, I know we often need quick advice for studying, coding, or staying motivated. This project shows I can create useful software while learning how different technologies work together!


*Thanks for checking out my project!*
